The consign is to obtain the name, reference link, and price of the products displayed in the first three pages of Mercado Libre when searching for ‘camisetas’ and store this information in a text file to deliver to the client.

Technologies: WebdriverIO, JavaScript, NodeJS
Tools: Selectors Hub
Environment: Chrome (version 97.0.4692.71)

Known Issues: -

What went good:
Clean code
Modularization of functionalities
The program is expected to work regardless of the number of products or pages displayed in Mercado Libre at any moment
Implementation of Page Objects
Creation of a framework
Protection of sources via the getter method, eg: selectors in selectorsMercadoLibre.js

To Improve:
Selection of tools: use of WebdriverIO instead of Selenium
Code organization
Page Objects implementation

The program can be run by typing in the console: npm run test or npx wdio run wdio.conf.cjs.
